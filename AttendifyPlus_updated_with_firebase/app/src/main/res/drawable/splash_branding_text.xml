    <!-- "Research Project" Text -->
    <!-- Since vector drawables don't support text directly, we simulate it or user must provide an image.
         For this task, I will create a simple geometric representation or placeholder. 
         Ideally, this should be an SVG converted to VectorDrawable of the text "Research Project".
         
         Since I cannot generate complex font vectors on the fly, I will create a clean, modern
         text-like layout using paths or simple shapes, OR better yet, instruct the user to use an image if they want specific fonts.
         
         HOWEVER, to fulfill the request "modern and premium", I will try to create a sleek "badge" style 
         or just use a placeholder text representation.
         
         Actually, a better approach for "Branding Image" if I can't render text is to use a bitmap of the text.
         But I don't have a bitmap generator.
         
         Let's try to construct a simple "Version 1.0" and "Research Project" using a mocked up path for simplicity, 
         or just provide a placeholder that looks like a footer.
         
         Wait, I can use a View in the Activity layout for pre-Android 12, but for Android 12 Splash Screen API, 
         the branding image must be a drawable.
         
         I'll stick to a simple minimalist design using lines and shapes to represent "premium".
         
         Actually, I will create a drawable that references a bitmap if possible, but I don't have one.
         
         Alternative: I will use a simple layout in MainActivity to display this "Splash" content 
         AFTER the system splash screen fades out, creating a "extended splash" experience.
         
         BUT the user asked to "add in the splash screen".
         
         The system splash screen (Android 12+) only allows: Icon, Background, Branding Image.
         The Branding Image is only shown on devices that support it and it's static.
         
         Let's try to create a `splash_branding_text.xml` that is a layer-list with the text baked in? 
         No, can't bake text in XML drawable without a font.
         
         STRATEGY:
         1. I cannot generate a text-based VectorDrawable from scratch without the path data for the letters.
         2. I will implement a "Custom Splash Screen" Composable in MainActivity that shows up 
            IMMEDIATELY after the system splash screen. This allows full customization (Version, Text, Animations).
         3. This gives the "Seamless" experience: System Splash (Logo) -> Custom Splash (Logo + Text + Version) -> App.
